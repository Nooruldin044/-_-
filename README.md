# Code Alpha Internship Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains four web applications that I built during my internship at **Code Alpha**. The projects showcase various front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The projects are as follows:
  **Age Calculator**: An app to calculate your age based on your date of birth.
  **Book Library**: A simple app for managing a collection of books, allowing users to add, delete, and view books.
  **To-Do App**: A task manager app for keeping track of daily tasks, allowing users to add, mark as complete, and remove tasks.
  **Weather Forecast App**: An app that shows the weather forecast by fetching data from an API based on the user's location.
